# Academic-Experience
Projects, simulations, raports, essays, presentations and thesis that I made during my academic studies at AGH in the field of Technical Physics.

In this repository I collected all my representative work that I have done during my studies. I did not include the work that I have done
in collaboration with other students. Every project and laboratory class includes a pdf that is a raport, an essay or a presentation
that comprehensively explains the topic and the work that has been done.

Topics touched in this repository:
  - Solid state physics
  - Quantum physics
  - Statistical physics
  - Enviromental physics
  - Theoretical physics
  - Finite element method
